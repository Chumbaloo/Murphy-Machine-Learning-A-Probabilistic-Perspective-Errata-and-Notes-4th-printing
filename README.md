         The newly updated errata can be downloaded from my Github: https://github.com/ks838

@Notes: 
        1. In this project, I listed the printing and mathematical typos I found in the 4th printing (the 5th, 6th are the same as the 4th printing). I wish this would be helpful for other readers. 
        2. A drawback, in my view, is that some of the notations and notes of the figures in the book tend to be explained not very clearly. The axes are often not labeled. 
        3. I implemented some of the algorithms to do nonlinear regression, please refer to

@Introduction of the book:
        1. This is a great book, which I have spent a lot of effort on it. I think it has a similar style as the most famous  Course of Theoretical Physics by Landau and Lifshitz. 
        2. There is only one edition till now (Jan, 2018). As the author Kevin Murphy said (I emailed him), the 2nd edition would appear at the end of 2018. We believe the second edition would include more on deep learning and reinforcement learning.
